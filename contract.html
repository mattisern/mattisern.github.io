      <li>The Facilitator’s role is to hold the structure and share readings and exercises as a fellow practitioner.</li>
      <li>The Course is not therapy, medical treatment, or initiation, and no guarantees of specific outcomes are offered.</li>

    The Facilitator may, at discretion, request confirmation from a licensed professional if suitability is uncertain.</p>

    <p><strong>2.3 Removal for Safety</strong><br>
    The Facilitator may remove a Participant if participation appears harmful to themself or the group.

      Missed group sessions are not refundable.
      Participants may access internal notes or recordings if provided.
    </p>

    </p>
