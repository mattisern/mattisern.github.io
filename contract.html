    <h1>Participant Agreement</h1>
    <p><strong>The Eight Gates – A Guided Exploration of the Esoteric Arts</strong></p>
    <p><em>Course Start: January 5, 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      This Participant Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between
      <strong>Mattis Erngren</strong> (“Facilitator”) and the enrolling Participant.
      By completing payment through <strong>Stripe Checkout</strong> for
      <em>The Eight Gates – A Guided Exploration of the Esoteric Arts</em> (the “Course”),
      the Participant acknowledges and agrees to the following terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Course is an exploratory study program focused on practical and philosophical aspects of the esoteric arts—alchemy, hermeticism, metaphysics, and higher-self communication.</li>
      <li>The Facilitator’s role is to hold the structure and share readings and exercises as a fellow practitioner.</li>
      <li>The Course is not therapy, medical treatment, or initiation, and no guarantees of specific outcomes are offered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Health & Psychological Responsibility</h2>
    <p><strong>2.1 Not a Substitute for Therapy</strong><br>
      The Course is intended for educational and spiritual exploration only. It is not designed to diagnose, treat, or cure any physical or psychological condition.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2.2 Participant’s Responsibility</strong><br>
      The Participant affirms that they are in stable psychological condition and will seek professional assistance if needed. The Facilitator may, at discretion, suggest pausing or discontinuing participation if suitability is uncertain.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2.3 Removal for Safety and Refunds</strong><br>
      The Facilitator may remove a Participant if participation appears harmful to themself or the group. In such cases, a proportional refund will be issued for the remaining sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Participation & Commitment</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1 Course Fee</strong><br>
      A one-time <strong>Course Fee</strong> of <strong>888 US dollars</strong> is paid securely through Stripe Checkout. The fee represents a commitment to presence and the full course process, not a payment for guaranteed outcomes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3.2 Payment & Confirmation</strong><br>
      Payment is made via Stripe Checkout using a link provided by the Facilitator. Enrollment is confirmed automatically once payment is completed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3.3 Refund Policy</strong><br>
      No refunds are offered except under the conditions outlined in §2.3 or if the Facilitator cancels the course before it begins.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3.4 Missed Sessions</strong><br>
      Missed group sessions are not refundable. Participants may access internal notes or recordings if provided.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Confidentiality & Group Conduct</h2>
    <p><strong>4.1 Privacy</strong><br>
      All personal sharing within the group is confidential and should not be discussed outside the Course.
    </p>

    <p><strong>4.2 Recording</strong><br>
      Recording, screenshots, or redistribution of materials are not permitted without explicit consent from the Facilitator.
    </p>

    <p><strong>4.3 Respectful Behaviour</strong><br>
      Participants must maintain respect and goodwill toward all. Disruptive or harmful behaviour may result in removal without refund.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All written, audio, and visual materials created by the Facilitator remain the property of Mattis Erngren.
      Participants receive a limited, non-transferable licence for personal use only.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Logistics & Communication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One group session per week (online), with optional 1-on-1 sessions.</li>
      <li>Primary communication occurs via email; responses are typically within 48 hours.</li>
      <li>Group sessions are primarily scheduled in the evening (Central European Time). If that schedule conflicts with a Participant’s timezone or work hours, an alternative session time will be arranged before the course begins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Governing Law & Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      This Agreement is governed by Swedish law, with Uppsala District Court as the venue for any disputes.<br>
      All personal data are processed in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      This document constitutes the entire understanding between the Facilitator and the Participant and supersedes prior communication. Amendments must be in writing and agreed upon by both parties.
